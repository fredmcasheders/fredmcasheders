Policymakers should act now to eliminate the lump-sum payday loan in the 35 states where it currently thrives. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other policymakers should take steps to make all small-dollar loans safer and more affordable by instituting the following requirements: 

Limit payments to an affordable percentage of a borrower's periodic income. (Research indicates that payments above 5 percent of gross income are unaffordable.) 
Spread costs evenly over the life of the loan. 
Guard against harmful repayment or collection practices. 
Require concise disclosures that reveal both periodic and total costs. 
States should continue to set maximum allowable charges on loans for those with poor credit.
