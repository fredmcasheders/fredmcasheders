Most small-dollar loan borrowers can afford to put no more than 5 percent of their paycheck toward a loan payment and still be able to cover basic expenses. Survey and market data show that loan payments exceeding 5 percent of a borrower's individual gross income are unaffordable. Higher payments should be prohibited unless lenders demonstrate, through rigorous underwriting, that borrowers can afford more than that amount. 
In the 35 states that allow lump-sum payday loans, repayment of these loans requires approximately one-third of an average borrower's paycheck. In Colorado, where lawmakers required that loans be repayable in affordable installments, payments take up only 4 percent of a borrower's paycheck on average.  
Safeguards are needed to create successful small-dollar loan markets. Ensuring that borrowers can repay loans in installments over time will help alleviate the harms of payday lending. But unless policymakers also ensure that loans are structured according to the borrower's ability to repay—and protect against lenderdriven refinancing, noncompetitive pricing, excessively long loan lengths, and abusive repayment or collection practices—consumers will remain at risk.
